# preTDR plot

Here are some of the plots used for the pre-TDR for the ePIC SIDIS group.

- **efficiency**: Is calculated as the ratio among the correctly reconstructed hadrons over their total MC production in each $x_B,Q^2,z,P_{hT}$ bins.
- **purity**: Calculated as the ration among the correctly reconstructed hadrons over the total reconstructed hadrons (i. e. total reconstructed kaons which are MC kaons / total reconstructed kaons without a MC PID associations).
- **ratio**: Is $$\frac{1}{p\cdot\sqrt{N\cdot e}}$$ where $N$ is scaled at $10fb^{-1}$, $p$ is the purity and $e$ the efficiency.
